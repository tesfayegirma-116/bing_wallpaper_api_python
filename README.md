# Bing Wallpaper Downloader

This script downloads the daily Bing wallpaper and saves it to a local folder. The script is written in Python 3 and uses the `requests` and `urllib` libraries to fetch the wallpaper from Bing's API, as discussed in this [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10639914/is-there-a-way-to-get-bings-photo-of-the-day).

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `requests` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git

2. Install the required library:

pip install requests


## Usage

Run the script using the following command:


The script will download the daily Bing wallpaper and save it to the `Downloaded_Wallpapers` folder in the same directory as the script. If the daily wallpaper has not changed, the script will print a message and exit without downloading the image again.

## Example

Here's an example of the output when running the script:

Downloaded daily wallpaper: 2023-04-22_12-30-45.jpg


This means the wallpaper has been downloaded and saved as `2023-04-22_12-30-45.jpg` in the `Downloaded_Wallpapers` folder.
